# MyPortfolio

## Task

In this Portfolio, I will be showcasing how I built the code for my portfolio from scratch. This portfolio will showcase my skills and talents that employers will be looking for in order to get a certain position. This portfolio will highlight all of my strongest work as well as the process behind it. 

This portfolio webpage will contain how I have implemented certain aspects of code such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. 


### Task breakdown
I started this webpage by first creating a repository, then using Visual Studio Code to write up my code. However, before typing up the code for the webpage, I first thought of the layout for the page. Once I had that down, I was able to carry on and write up the code knowing exactly what I wanted and where.
