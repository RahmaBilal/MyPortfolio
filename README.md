# MyPortfolio

## Task

In this Portfolio, I will be showcasing how I built the code for my portfolio from scratch. This portfolio will showcase my skills and talents that employers will be looking for in order to get a certain position. This portfolio will highlight all of my strongest work as well as the process behind it. 

This portfolio webpage will contain how I have implemented certain aspects of code such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. 


### Task breakdown
I started this webpage by first creating a repository, then using Visual Studio Code to write up my code. However, before typing up the code for the webpage, I first thought of the layout for the page. Once I had that down, I was able to carry on and write up the code knowing exactly what I wanted and where. 

I set up the nav tags in the header and made it so that whenever the contents were viewed, whether it was on a phone or laptop, the respected screen sizing would appear. Therefore, it would automatically resize according to the device screen.

After completing the resizing, I went onto sorting out the design of the page and where everything would go. I made it so that when someone would hover over a certain part of the nav bar, the color of the text would change. I then changed the background color of the webpage so that the nav bar was visible. I also made sure that when the webpage was viewed on different screens, the nav bar would change from being in a row, in the center of the page to being a column. The image below shows that when you hover over the nav bar links then they change color. <img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 13 39 55" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108250116/178991208-97f47626-bbb0-4c0e-9912-f94344104ad4.png">

This one shows when you change screens, how everything aligns and is centered. This is by using media queries. <img width="1440" alt="Screenshot 2022-07-14 at 15 29 31" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/108250116/179006865-e1aae77d-1970-4e73-8e9d-46002a4a0564.png">

When I completed that, then I went onto adding a profile picture as well as adding my name and links to my work. I added placeholder names and pictures of my own previous work. Then I moved onto sorting out the placement of where every webpage would be on the page. The image below shows the placements of everything.

Now I added the pictures for the projects and attached a link to show that they are all different projects and will go to a different url. The screenshots below show the placements of the projects. However, I still need to put the 'About' and 'Contact' section below the projects. Therefore, when a certain section is clicked on from the nav bar, it goes straight to the part.
