# MyPortfolio

## Task

In this Portfolio, I will be showcasing how I built the code for my portfolio from scratch. This portfolio will showcase my skills and talents that employers will be looking for in order to get a certain position. This portfolio will highlight all of my strongest work as well as the process behind it. 

This portfolio webpage will contain how I have implemented certain aspects of code such as flexbox, media queries and CSS variables. 


### Task breakdown
I started this webpage by first creating a repository, then using Visual Studio Code to write up my code. However, before typing up the code for the webpage, I first thought of the layout for the page. Once I had that down, I was able to carry on and write up the code knowing exactly what I wanted and where. 

I set up the nav tags in the header and made it so that whenever the contents were viewed, whether it was on a phone or laptop, the respected screen sizing would appear. Therefore, it would automatically resize according to the device screen.

After completing the resizing, I went onto sorting out the design of the page and where everything would go. I made it so that when someone would hover over a certain part of the nav bar, the color of the text would change. I then changed the background color of the webpage so that the nav bar was visible. I also made sure that when the webpage was viewed on different screens, the nav bar would change from being in a row, in the center of the page to being a column.
